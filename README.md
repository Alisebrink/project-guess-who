# Project Name

I have made a Guess who game. When the game loads the game picks a secret person and you get to ask the game answers that then filters out people depending on who the secret person is. 

## The problem

First thing I did was trying to read and understand the code that was given to me. In the beginning this was difficult but in the end I got it working. For me the most difficult part this week has been trying to understand the starter code. 
I changed the CSS, added a guess counter, a timer and some sound effects to make it more fun to play.
